----Roadmap----

Overall Organization
	Each minigame would need to be its own scene, and they get pseudorandomly loaded in
	when the previous game gets finished. Inbetween each minigame, a splashscreen of a few seconds
	shows current standings before going to the next screen

	Thinks to think about:
		Handling draws (make next game worth 2x?)
		Implementing drinking (not sure if we can hook up the machine in time, but
				       we can have an ingame tally of drinks that are to be
				       taken, maybe every few minigames theres a longer pause
				       to have the players take their drinks)
		Tournament Mode?
		----->>>>>Do we focus on having it run on just a laptop for now and fit it into the pi later?<<<--------
		

Main Menu
	On Start
		-> Send to prep screen
	Settings
		->Volume, res, fullscreen
	Quit
		->Quit


Prep Screen
	-> Score to win
	-> Game speed/difficulty
	-> Controller assignment

Tournament Mode
	-> Could be really cool, especially at big events
	-> People enter their names and whatever
	-> Could be some persistent lifeline between matches

Minigames

These should take less than 10 seconds, and be very easily recognizable

	Quickdraw
		-> Hidden, random timer
		-> Ready.... Steady.... Draw!! type thing
		-> Fastest reaction time after Draw!! popup
		-> Chance of bait Draw!! popups

	Rock Paper Scissors
		-> 1 round
		-> Redo on draw
		-> Everyone's gonna do roche roche roche, so penalize them so that they can fuck off after a bunch in a row

	Price is Right Timer thing
		-> Get as close to a certain amount of seconds without passing it
		-> Timer is initially shown, but disappears after a few seconds
		
	Coin Toss
		-> Literally a coin toss, fuck you

	Versus Snake
		-> Like Agar.io, but regular snake 
		-> Really fast

	Google Dino Run
		-> First to die loses
		-> But it's fast so you die quick

	Tug-of-War
		-> Button mash battle
		-> Winner declared when difference of presses passes a certain thresh,
			or whoever is ahead after x seconds

	Button sequences
		-> Input a random sequence as fast as possible

	War 
		-> The card game, just draw a card
	
	Dice throw
		-> Throw dice, fuck you if you lose

	DDR
		-> Tiny rhythm game

	Add whatever you can think of, I'd like at least 10 of them, eventually there can be like 50+

QoL/UI stuff

	Something that could be cool is to let players pick a color to represent themselves,
	and that color be reflected in the minigames

	I'll try to see if I can write some music for the game, I have an idea of dynamic music 
	changing to reflect the current winner
